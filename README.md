# 🖥️ Terminal Card Website

**terminal-card** is a minimal, single-page personal website that looks and behaves like a terminal.
It features command input, history navigation, bash-like autocompletion (commands + args), and a tiny virtual filesystem for `ls`/`cat`.
 
> This website were generated by **ChatGPT** based on the author’s prompts and requirements.

## ✨ Features

* Terminal-style UI (prompt, output, input row)
* Commands: `help`, `about`, `projects`, `contact`, `clear`
* “Terminal-ish” commands: `ls`, `cat <file>`, `open <target>`, `github`, `whoami`, `echo`
* Autocomplete:
  * Command completion (`he<Tab>` → `help`)
  * Argument completion:
    * `cat RE<Tab>` → `cat README.md`
    * `open g<Tab>` → `open github`
* Command history: `↑/↓`
* Clear screen: `Ctrl+L`
* Data-driven `projects`: rendered from a JS array of objects (name/description/url)
* Zero build step (plain HTML/CSS/JS)
* Works great on GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel
